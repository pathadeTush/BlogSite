''' The baseclass for all your models is called db.Model. It’s stored on the SQLAlchemy instance that we have created. Which 'db' see __init__.py file

 some parts that are required in SQLAlchemy are optional in Flask-SQLAlchemy. For instance the table name is automatically set for you unless overridden. It’s derived from the class name converted to lowercase and with “CamelCase” converted to “camel_case”. To override the table name, set the __tablename__ class attribute. You can check tabelname on interpreter as User.query.all()[1].__tablename__

 UserMixin model is used to handel user sessions like is_active, is_anonymous, is_authenticated, get_id(). It provides default implementations for all of these properties and methods. (It’s not required, though.)'''

 Implies each User created has data member posts which is related with another class named Post and we can access all posts of that user via posts data member

backref adds another column in database here it is 'author'.We can access posts using author.lazy = True means this relationship is supposed to load in one go
